I dont know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town. Lets move on.

       "\"I wouldn't walk over there. Why not? It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops a curb, wap! You've had your last egg sandwich. What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time. I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner than a two ton cab. No, cab's comin' in right here (Hand at waist) Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business. Much rather take it to the head, Like I did in '79. You were livin' in the village then, right? Don't really remember. (Showing fingernails) Toxic waste green. That is disgusting. You know, revulsion has now become a valid form of attraction. Well, then you're drivin' me wild. I had 'em done for the big Peterman bash I'm throwin'. (George enters) Oh, why you havin' a party? I drive my people hard, and then I reward them. Like with dogs. Exactly. Party? Yeah. Food? Uh huh. Bar? Yeah. George? He's gonna show up anyway. George, I just don't want you interfering. How could I possibly interfere? Isn't that what Jack Ruby said? (Eating) Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic. (To server) You know, I'd love to get a jump on the next batch, where do you come out? (Server leaves) (To Anna) She's been ignoring this section all night. Quesadilla? No thanks. Hi ah, My name is George. Anna. I don't recall seeing you around the office. Do you work in the mail room? No, I'm a friend of Elaine Benes. Oh. Excuse me. (She leaves) So... How 'bout leading us in a toast? Oh sure. Hey guys, I wanna make a toast. Um... Here's to us who wish us well, and those who don't can go to hell... All right, who's dancin'? C'mon, who's dancin'? You want me, You want me to get it started? I'll get it started. Whew! (She dances) Sweet Fancy Moses! You get the tickets? Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow. Death Blow When someone tries to blow you up, not because of who you are, but for different reasons altogether. (Jerry buzzes up George) Jerry, do you think you can get an extra ticket for my friend Brody? Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these? Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know I'd consider it a personal favor to me. Yeah I guess I do owe you. Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets up? No, I'm okay. There's no problem, really. I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party? Food was good. Yeah, so I didn't miss anything? Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment. (Pause) Have you ever seen Elaine dance? Elaine danced? It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music. Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs? What, you mean you know about this? For some time... (video of Elaine dancing on the street with Jerry and the street musicians watching her awful dance) It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away. Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit rock bottom. And by then you've lost interest. Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my father's car. '68 GTO. What made him get that thing? During that period when my folks were separated he went a little crazy. Not a very long trip. (Enter Kramer) Brody's in. I don't even have the extra ticket yet. Well, you better get on the horn. I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me. (Staff mocks her dancing in the background) How could that be? Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party? No, George was there, he said he had a great time. Ah, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related. Oh, what are you talkin' about? He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host company, and the next thing you know, the entire staff's infected. Now you're talkin' crazy! All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me. What is it? (Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'. You have a minute to approve some copy? Oh yeah, sure, sure. So ah, did ya have a good time at the party last night? It was a real... kick. Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George? As a matter of fact I did. Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance from him. Why? He seems harmless. Oh he's not. He's very harmful. Really? Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's one of the worst seeds I've ever seen. And you two are friends? Yeah, we're good friends. So this Anna called me from out of the blue. Really? I thought you were rebuffed. With extreme prejudice. Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you. No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine said I was one of the worst seeds she'd ever seen. Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy. I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy. You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend... Yes ... yes, yes The bad fianc&Mac226;, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk... Okay, the point is made. The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at table as George exits) The bad tipper! Half of show business is here. There's Brody. Brody! Over here. Hey Kramer. And you must be Jerry. Thanks for the ticket. That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there. It's for all of us. Is there a problem? Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry. I'm a joke maker. All right, here we go, Death Blow. (Brody takes out video camera) (To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing? Relax, he does that all the time. Does what? He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street, hum? May I see you outside for a moment please? But I want to-- Outside! Hey, have you seen Anna? Uh, she just went to meet your friend George. To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go? The park, why? Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away from him, too! What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie? Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business. It's not legitimate. It's a business. Where did you meet this guy? He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on 94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pachinco-- Kramer. (boom sound) Man, we're missin' the Death Blow! I don't believe this. (They run into theater) You know I'm not supposed to be talking to you. No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you? No... a little. Nice car. Yeah, she's a sweet ride. Is that your orthopedic back pillow? Maybe. Well is it or isn't it? Guess not. (To George) Stay away from her. I didn't do nothin'. (To Anna) Get in the car. But... You heard me young lady, get in the car. (To George) And you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff. Lighten up. Go get 'em, Death Blow! (To Brody) You okay? So Death Blow, we meet again ...) Uh, I got a cramp. Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy. Uh, there it goes again. Kramer, you gotta drive me home. Hey, what is going on over there? Jerry, finish shooting the movie for me. Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing. Jerry, if the man is in pain... Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right. (pulls out a gun) What are you some kind of tough guy? Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera. All right, I'm, i,m takin' the camera. (To Brody) C'mon, let's go. Oh man... Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow? How was the rest of Death Blow? Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that Hawaiian guy, he had it comin' to him! Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point! He's quite a character, isn't he? You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind! I got it. Yep. Brody. Come on up. It's Brody. What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again. Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up and thank you. What if I didn't do it right? It's your first time. He'll understand. People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings. Hey, Brody! Hi. Jerry, I have to talk to you about the tape. Yeah. I've never seen such beautiful work. What? (con,t) You're a genius. The zoom-ins, the framing. I was enchanted. Well, I did the best I could. I got another project for you. It's a movie called Cry Cry Again. I was gonna give it to one of my other guys, but it's an arty movie and quite frankly, they don't have the sensibility. May I use your phone? Uh yeah. It's under the couch. Look at you! You've got another gig! Uhh. I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this. But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy act. We're talkin' feature films. We're talkin' federal crime here. (To Jerry) I'll expect that tape by three o'clock tomorrow. (To Kramer) May I borrow this? (Holding baseball bat) Sure, do you need a glove? Nah. I pressed through the rushes and there, the native dancers whirled before me limbs flailing, arms akimbo, feet kicking up dust... (All workers laugh) What? What is so funny? Sorry, I got hung up. At Yankee Stadium? This? It's mine. Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear. He's not stocky. Who did that? Who did that?!? (laughing) The French guy fell off his bike. Oh man, that's precious. (eats popcorn) No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this? That's fine. Do you even know what this scene is about? It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread. No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul. Wha? Where? Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it. Nah, nah, he's not going to know the difference. I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted. So you'll do the movie? (Jerry watches the movie Kramer shot - we hear Kramer, on the tape say 'Ah man, I sat in gum') I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers? Right here. (Elaine enters) Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing, Kramer flips out) What? (He shows her) This umpf thing. It's dancing. No, no. That ain't dancing, Sally. I dance fine. You stink. (He exits) He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. (Jerry fake laughs) Jer? Jerry, I'm a good dancer, right? I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away) Jerry, do I stink? All right, you're beyond stink. But I really enjoy dancing. And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George. It's that bad? Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back. I have George Costanza still holding. George, hi. I have Anna here. There's something I wanna say to both of you. Yo, Anna. Hi, George. What're you up to? (Ironing) You don't wanna know. Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize. What, wha, what're you talkin' about? Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that you're a good and decent person. Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up! I never should have given Anna the impression-- Pick it up, pick it up! --that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed. Elaine, get off the speaker! (Elaine picks up phone) What? You are ruinin' everything. I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult. I'm a difficult seed. George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna talk to George? Um, no, I don't think so. No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya. I'm a bad man! So where's the tape? No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location. I need the tape. You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony. And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to talk to 'em. Are you out of your mind? Kramer... I know, Jerry. It's okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah, look, Brody. Uh, Jerry wants to do the bootleg. He's dyin' to do it. But if you don't make him happy, the work suffers. And then, nobody's happy. Just shoot the damn thing so I can get it out on the street! All right. That's it, I can't work like this. Jerry... I'm off the project. (He exits) Jerry! I want the tape. Yeah. Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that? They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs. Anna actually has respect for me now. (laughs/snorts) It's all over. Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money now. The sad thing is it's the kids that suffer. (Kramer enters) Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody, he's a reasonable man, but he's insane! Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous... Did you say dangerous? I'm a bootlegger. You're a what? I'm bootleggin' a movie, baby! Isn't that illegal? I can do hard time for this one. And community service! Is this your FiberCon? (Takes it and throws it out window) Get outta my way! Jerry, George got arrested. What? Yeah. He went down at the Beackman, he tried to lam, but they cheesed him. Oh now I see. (Buzzer) Yeah. Brody, I'm comin' up. What're we gonna do? Well, I ah, gotta give him something. Come on, where's that tape I shot? I think that's it. (They play it and see Elaine dancing) Sweet fancy Moses! Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! (Brody enters) Where's the tape? Uh, well. It, uh... Is that it? Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry Again. How'd it turn out? Uh... great. Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there. Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears to be injured. Yeah, it's a disturbing image. Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancing, you cry again. (George is crying) It's all right, George. You'll just pay a fine and that'll be it. Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? (Elaine enters) Anna... Oh, Elaine, thanks for picking me up. I can explain everything. All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office. (Mr. Costanza enters) Okay, where's my boy? Oh my God. I'm sitting at home, reading a periodical, and this is the call I get? My son is a bootlegger? (He hits George in the head) Ow! Dad... Who put you up to this, was it her? All right. Wait a minute. I think you've got it backwards. My George isn't clever enough to hatch a scheme like this. You got that right. What the hell does that mean? That means whatever the hell you want it to mean. You sayin' you want a piece of me? I could drop you like a bag of dirt. You wanna piece of me? You got it! (They begin to fight) But he's an old man, Elaine. Well, he wrote the check, and I cashed it. (Seeing a street vendor) Hey, it's the bootlegged Death Blow that I shot. Oh, Cry Cry Again, I wanna see that. No you don't. You shot Death Blow? Yeah. That was brilliant. Thank you. (They continue walking) You were big. I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how are things at the office? Back to normal? Yeah, pretty much. Although I still get the vibe every once in a while. I wouldn't worry about it. (People on sidewalk behind them are doing her dance as they go)\""

       "'I can\\'t eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? \"How\\'s everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?\" I know what you mean. Do ya? It\\'s like going out with someone and you never hear from them again. Same thing! Not really, but it\\'s something. Ask the people behind you. Excuse me. Are you using your catsup? What do you think? You want to give him the catsup? It\\'s up to you. You know what? I don\\'t think so. I\\'m going to need it from time to time. So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies? Nah - what for? To see a movie. I\\'ve been to the movies. Not this movie. They\\'re all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I\\'m sick of it. Did you shower today? Yeah. That\\'s usually the kind of mood I\\'m in when I haven\\'t showered. When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my 15 minutes! Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health. Ah! Health\\'s not good enough. I want more than health. Health\\'s not doing it for me anymore. I\\'m sick of health. All right, we\\'re done. You can have it now. Oh, very gracious. Nice day Yeah. What is that? Hey! JoJo! Ey, ey! All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer. No, thank you. So what are you doing? Nothing. Come on, let\\'s go to the beach. What are you crazy? What? It\\'s a beautiful day. Have a good time. Yeah, there\\'s something in the air today. You feel it? There\\'s something in the air. You know you\\'re turning into Burt Lancaster? Yeah, there\\'s something in the air. Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it\\'s Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can\\'t hear you so good. There\\'s a lot of static. Wha? I\\'m going to call you back. Jill\\'s father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone? What? No good? Faux pas. Faux pas? Big hefty stinking faux pas. Why? You can\\'t make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It\\'s like saying \"I don\\'t want to take up any of my important time in my home so I\\'ll just get it out of the way on the street.\" On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make. It\\'s an act of total disregard. It\\'s selfish. It\\'s dismissive. It\\'s pompous. Why don\\'t you think before you do something? Here\\'s a thought - Bye bye. Too much? Boy - I\\'m really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should know better than that. Hey - hey - hey! What? Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend. You\\'re so uptight. Uptight? Let\\'s all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We\\'re going up to Jerry\\'s. It\\'s a pee party. Jerry, this is Elizabeth Clark calling from James Kimbrough\\'s office at NBC. Could you please give us a call?Thanks. Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi? Uh huh, really, uh, no problem, definitely, ok, buhbye. That was James Kimbrough. Who\\'s he? He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about \"Jerry.\" Our show, \"Jerry\"? Right. \"Jerry\", oh my God. He wants to talk about \"Jerry\"? Yeah! When? Today, like right now. Right now? \"Jerry\"? \"Jerry\"! He wants to talk about \"Jerry\"? He wants to talk about \"Jerry\"! \"Jerry\"! \"Jerry\"! Can I go like this? Sure! No sports jacket? I don\\'t need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets. Forget the sports jacket. I won\\'t feel like a writer. You\\'re not a writer. Right! Water. Need some water! Water here! Ok, now listen, I don\\'t want any scenes in here like the last time. Don\\'t worry, don\\'t worry, no scenes. Don\\'t blow this. I will not blow this. If he says he doesn\\'t want it to be a show about nothing, don\\'t go nuts. It\\'s fine, it doesn\\'t have to be about nothing. He might not want nothing. Something, nothing, I could care less. He might want a show about anything and everything. Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I\\'m down! All right. Mr. Kimbrough is ready to see you Magic time. What? nothing Mr. Kimbrough. Hey, Jerry, good to see you. Hey, hey, hey! How you been? Good, good. You remember George. George, good to see you. Hello Stu. You remember Jay Crespi. Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi? This is James Kimbrough. Nice to meet you, pleasure, thanks for coming in. Kimbrough. Don\\'t spell. K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H That\\'s right. It\\'s a talent I have. Why don\\'t we sit down, glad you\\'re here. Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It\\'s crisp - it\\'s crispy crisp. Shut up, George. Can I get you anything? What do we have in the fruit department? Oy. Pineapple. Oh, that\\'s a dangerous fruit. It\\'s like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things. Anyway, let me tell you why I called. When I took over here last month, I reviewed what was in development,and it was pretty much same old, same old. Been there, done that. Right. I was looking for something different. Something that would have people talking at the water coolers. Water coolers? We call it a water-cooler show. Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right? See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines. Well it\\'s probably just easier to say \"water cooler show\" than \"coffee machine show.\" It\\'s really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles. But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point. Anyway, Stu here started telling me about a show, \"Jerry\", that he developed five years ago. I have always loved it. He said it was a show about nothing. So, I saw the pilot and I\\'ve got to tell you - I flipped out. He totally flipped out. What I want to do is put it on the air. 13-episode commitment. Start it off on Wednesday night, build up an audience. This show needs time to grow. I love that Kramer guy. He\\'s a little off the wall. Oh yeah. Kramer. And Elaine - I wouldn\\'t mind seeing something happening between you two. Definitely. I tell you, I really don\\'t think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about. Or we could not do the show altogether, how about that? Or we could get them together. Woo! Yeah! Yeah! Jill, hi, it\\'s Elaine. Well, I\\'m calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was just calling to see how your fa.. I\\'m sorry, I\\'m getting another call. Hang on just a second. Hello? Hi. Elaine, it\\'s me. Jerry, I\\'m on the other line. No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone. I\\'m sorry, Jill. I\\'m going to have to take this call. Jerry, what\\'s the emergency? The \"Jerry\"\\'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to California! That\\'s the emergency? Did you hear what I said? I was on the other line talking to Jill. Jill? Well, why didn\\'t you say so? You said it was an emergency. So now she\\'s lost a phone face-off? That\\'s even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk. Congratulations, they\\'re doing the show. They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network. Can I tell you something, Jerry? It\\'s all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six. She\\'s not six-six. Jerry, you ever watch that? Yeah, it\\'s pretty good. They picked up the show? I\\'m moving to California. Oh baby-doll, this kid\\'s going places, I told you. The NBC guy liked it? Of course he liked it. He told you he liked it? He wouldn\\'t put it on if he didn\\'t like it. Well, what are you doing? I\\'m writing. You know how to write? Without the writing, you have nothing. You\\'re the ones that make them look good. Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything. Ma?! I don\\'t know how you\\'re going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas? Would you leave him alone? You\\'ll shatter his confidence! I don\\'t need any ideas. It\\'s a show about nothing. Nothing. Please. I\\'ll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me. NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That\\'s fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye. Oh hey! Hey - how was the beach? Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing? You know, I went swimming and I can\\'t get this water out of my ear. So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, \"Jerry\"? Well, the new guy at NBC wants to do it. They\\'re putting it on the air! They\\'re giving us a 13-episode commitment. George and I are moving to California! You\\'re moving to California? Yeah, only for a while. Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show\\'s a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back. No, I\\'ll be back. Jerry. It\\'s L.A. Nobody leaves. She\\'s a seductress, she\\'s a siren, she\\'s a virgin, she\\'s a whore. And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we\\'ll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California. Fling! So we can go anywhere we want? Anywhere. Why are they doing this? I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years. This is all very exciting. So? Where are we going? I say Japan. Why Japan? Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They\\'re shy at first, but they\\'re quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking. Oh - I got it - how about Russia? Russia, it\\'s so bleak. It\\'s not bleak - it\\'s springtime. It\\'s still bleak. You can\\'t be bleak in spring. You can be bleak in spring. If you\\'re bleak, you\\'re bleak. What about Switzerland? Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh? It\\'s a bit hilly - no? You\\'re not going to do any walking. What if I want to walk around a little? So then you\\'ll walk down the hill and we\\'ll pick you up. What if I\\'m at the bottom? All right! You know what, just forget it! Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let\\'s face it, we\\'re not all going to agree on anything. Why don\\'t we all just go to Paris? I\\'ll go to Paris. Me too. Oh yeah - oui oui. So that\\'s it - it\\'s settled, we\\'re going to Paris. Yeah! Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I\\'m just going to call Jill one more time before we go. Wait, you can\\'t make a call like that on your way out. You can\\'t rush that conversation. Well, I can\\'t call from the limo. Can I call from the plane? First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you\\'re talking about a plane call? All right, I\\'ll just have to call her from Paris. Hello, Jerry. Hello, Newman. What gives? I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris? Yeah, that\\'s right. Well, I hear it\\'s quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know I\\'m one-quarter French. Really. Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won\\'t interest you, but I have a cousin there who\\'s suffering very badly. She\\'s lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can\\'t afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker. That\\'s a shame. Take me! Take me! Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You\\'re making me sick. Be a man! All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I\\'ll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down. Ah, Jerry? Yeah. I\\'m Captain Maddox this is my co-pilot, Kurt Adams. Ready to go to Paris? All set. We\\'ll just grab the bags. Don\\'t worry about that. We\\'ll take care of them for you. Just keeps on getting better and better. Not bad. Wow! The only way to fly. This is it? I\\'m sorry - I have to say, I\\'m a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer. You\\'re complaining about a private jet? You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets? Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore. Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one. Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip. This is a real piece of junk. I don\\'t even feel safe on this thing. I have a good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough. You\\'re not writing any letters! Will you turn around? Why? You are annoying me sitting like that. It\\'s effeminate. It\\'s effeminate to sit like this? Yes, I think it\\'s a little effeminate. How is this effeminate? I don\\'t know - it just is. Kramer, what are you doing? Still got water in your ear? Can\\'t get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain. Would you stop that? It\\'s not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane. I got to get it out, I can\\'t take this anymore. Kramer, don\\'t be fooling around up here. Kramer! Hey, get the hell out of here! What is that? Oh my God! What is that noise? What is that noise? Kramer, what the hell did you do? I lost my balance. Oh my God! What\\'s going on? Kramer! It was an accident. I told you to stop with the hopping. Oh my God, we\\'re going down. We\\'re going to die! Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn\\'t let me be successful. Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can\\'t- it can\\'t end like this. I\\'m ready! I\\'m ready! Glory hallelujah! Jerry? Jerry can you hear me? Yeah. There\\'s something I have to tell you. What? What is it? I cheated in the contest. What? What? The contest - I cheated. Why? Because I\\'m a cheater! I had to tell you. Great - I won. Jerry, I gotta tell you something too. Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you. No no - me first. Alright. Jerry, I\\'ve always loved ..u.. Hey - What\\'s going on? We\\'re straightening out! We\\'re straightening out? We\\'re straightening out! We\\'re straightening out! Yeah! Well, again, sorry about that little mishap. But once you get everything checked out there shouldn\\'t be anymore problems. Where are we? Latham, Massachusetts. Why don\\'t you take a cab into town, get yourself something to eat. I got your beeper number - I\\'ll beep you as soon as we\\'re ready. Okay. Okay. We\\'ll see you later. Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get back on this plane? I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight. I\\'m not getting on a regular plane now - I\\'m all psyched up to go on a private jet. No way I\\'m getting on a regular plane. Well, I\\'m sure that they would fly us first class. First class doesn\\'t make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane. Alright, I\\'ll feel him out. Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up. Nice day. Another one? Alright fatso, out of the car. I want to capture this. Come on! Gimme your wallet. Don\\'t shoot. Well, there goes the money for the lipo. See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it\\'s an easy getaway. You know? They can\\'t really chase ya! He\\'s actually doing him a favor. It\\'s less money for him to buy food. I want your wallet. Come on. Come on, come on. That\\'s a shame. Alright, I\\'m gonna call NBC. Officer, he\\'s stealing my car! Officer, I was carjacked. I was held up at gunpoint! He took my wallet, everything! Okay, thanks anyway. They can\\'t get another plane. All right, what\\'s wrong with the plane we got? They\\'re just checking it out. Forget it. No, no, no. We\\'re not getting on there. Come on, let\\'s go get something to eat in Sticksville. All right, hold it right there. What? You\\'re under arrest. Under arrest? What for? Article 223-7 of the Latham County Penal Code. What? No, no - we didn\\'t do anything. That\\'s exactly right. The law requires you to help or assist anyone in danger as long as it\\'s reasonable todo so. I never heard of that. It\\'s new. It\\'s called the Good Samaritan Law. Let\\'s go. The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy? Why would we want to help somebody? I know. That\\'s what nuns and Red Cross workers are for. The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people. Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is. Well, they just passed it last year. It\\'s modeled after the French law. I heard about it after Princess Diana was killed and all those photographers were just standing around. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You\\'re the first ones to be arrested on it, probably in the whole country. All right, so what\\'s the penalty here? Let\\'s just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here. Well, it\\'s not that easy. Now see, the law calls for a maximum fine of $85,000 and as much as five years in prison. What? Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We\\'re starting a TV show. California? Oh gosh, I don\\'t think so. Yeah, my guess is you\\'re gonna be prosecuted. Better get yourselves a good lawyer. Who told you to put the cheese on? Did I tell you to put the cheese on? I didn\\'t tell you to put the cheese on. Jerry Seinfeld on the phone. You people with the cheese. It never ends. Hello? Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Good Samaritan Law? I never heard of it. You don\\'t have to help anybody. That\\'s what this country\\'s all about. That\\'s deplorable, unfathomable, improbable. Hold on. Suzie, cancel my appointment with Dr. Bison. And pack a bag for me. I want to get to Latham, Massachusetts,right away. So they got Jackie Chiles, huh? (Sets down the newspaper) Uh hmm. You know what that means. This whole place is going to be swarming with media by the time this thing is over. You\\'re not going to be able to find a hotel room in this town. The whole country is going to be watching us. Now we got to do whatever it takes to win it, no matter what the cost. The big issue in this trial is going to be character. I want you to find out everything you can about these people - and I mean everything. Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh? Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that\\'s it. I realize we\\'re prisoners, but we\\'re still entitled to catsup. I guess we could\\'ve called for help. But then we would have missed the whole thing. I still had it on video. We could have watched it later. Yeah, he\\'s right. I forgot about the video. Sure - the video. What is that? Plane\\'s ready. Hi everybody, I\\'m Geraldo Rivera. Tonight we\\'ll be talking about what most of you have probably been discussing in your homes, and around the water coolers in your offices. I am speaking of course of the controversial Good Samaritan trial that gets underway Thursday in Latham, Massachusetts. Now before we meet our distinguished panel, let\\'s go to Latham live, where Jane Wells is standing by. Jane- Yes. Good evening, Geraldo. What\\'s the mood? What\\'s going on tonight? Well, Latham is fairly quite tonight, considering the media circus that has descended upon this quaint little town. And what about the defendants - the so-called New York Four. How are they holding up? Well, I did speak with one of the deputies who had some contact with them, and he told me quote \"There\\'s no love lost with that group.\" Anything else, Jane? There also seems to be some friction between Mr. Seinfeld, and Ms. Benes. The rumor is that they once dated, and it\\'s possible that ended badly. Well, ladies and gentlemen, who know, maybe this trial will bring them closer together. Maybe they\\'ll even end up getting married. I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks. What\\'s all that? Cereal. You\\'re packing cereal? I\\'m bringing it for Jerry. You got enough here for a life sentence. He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything. So bring a snack-pack. Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault. Maybe it was your fault. It wasn\\'t my fault. I can tell you that. Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours. You were the one who smothered him. I did not smother him. You smothered! He couldn\\'t get any air! He couldn\\'t breathe! He was suffocating! Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis. I had to make a living! This is excellent huh? Don\\'t worry I didn\\'t use too much milk, cause I know we gotta make it last. You know I\\'ve had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I\\'ve always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can\\'t even see the milk anymore. It\\'s a big adjustment. I bet. It\\'s one of the hardest things I\\'ve ever had to do. Good morning. Good morning, Jackie. Good morning. Is everybody ready? Didn\\'t I tell you I wanted you to wear the cardigan? It makes me look older. Look older? Do you think this is a game? Is that what you think this is? I\\'m trying to give you amoral compass. You have no moral compass. You\\'re going to walk into that courtroom, and the jury\\'s going to see a mean, nasty, evil George Costanza. I want them to see Perry Como. No one\\'s going to convict Perry Como. Perry Como helps out a fat tub who\\'s getting robbed. Do you think it\\'s funny? No. You damn right it isn\\'t. You better not be carrying on laughing in that courtroom, funny man. Cause if you start getting all smart-alecky, making wisecracks, acting a fool, you gonna find yourself in here for a long, long time. I don\\'t like that tie. Suzie, get one of my ties from my briefcase. How do I look, Jackie? Oh, you looking good. You look strong. You one fine-looking sexy lady. Thank you, Jackie. How bout me, Jackie? Kramer, you always look good. You got respect for yourself. You\\'re genuine. Jury\\'s going to pick up on that. Here. This one? That\\'s right. Do I have to? Jackie says put it on, Jerry. All rise. Fourth District County Court, Latham, Massachusetts is now in session. The Honorable Judge Arthur Vandelay presiding. Vandelay? The judge\\'s name is Vandelay? Vanda who? Jerry, did you hear that? Yeah. I think that\\'s a good sign. Is the District Attorney ready to proceed? We are, Your Honor. Mr. Hoyt. Ladies and gentlemen, last year, our City Council by a vote of twelve to two, passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but, as we will prove, they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged, deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far. This time they are going to be held accountable. This time, they are the ones who will pay. Mr. Chiles. I am shocked and chagrined, mortified and stupefied. This trial is outrageous! It is a waste of the taxpayers\\' time and money. It is a travesty of justice that these four people have been incarcerated while the real perpetrator is walking around laughing - lying and laughing, laughing and lying. You know what these four people were? They were innocentbystanders. Now, you just think about that term. Innocent. Bystanders. Because that\\'s exactly what they were. We know theywere bystanders, nobody\\'s disputing that. So how can a bystander be guilty? No such thing. Have you ever heard of a guilty bystander? No, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders are by definition, innocent. That is the nature of bystanding. But no, they want to change nature here. They want to create a whole new animal - the guilty bystander. Don\\'t you let them do it. Only you can stop them. Is the prosecution ready to present its first witness? We are, Your Honor. Call Officer Matt Vogel to the stand. Call Matt Vogel. So they were just standing there? Yes. Did one of them have a video camera? Yes. Your Honor, with the court\\'s permission, we would like to play back that video and enter it into evidence as Exhibit A. Proceed. Don\\'t shoot. Well, there goes the money for the lipo. See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it\\'s an easy getaway. They can\\'t really chase ya! He\\'s actually doing him a favor. It\\'s less money for him to buy food. the victim of the robbery] So they just stood there and did nothing? Yeah, nothing. Nothing! No further questions. Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us killed! Call Mabel Choate to the stand. Call Mabel Choate. Your Honor. I most strenuously and vigorously object to this witness. She was not present at the time of the incident. Her testimony is irrelevant, irrational, and inconsequential. Your Honor, the prosecution has gone to great lengths and considerable cost to find these character witnesses.It is imperative that we establish this is not merely an isolated incident. It\\'s part of a pattern of anti-social behavior that\\'s been going on for years. Objection overruled. I\\'ll hear the witness. Now, Mrs. Choate, would you please tell the court what happen the evening of January 4th. Well, I was in Snitzer\\'s Bakery when I got accosted by that man. Let the record show that she is pointing at Mr. Seinfeld. What did he want? My marble rye. Your marble rye? I got the last one. He kept persisting, and I said no. And then you left the bakery. That\\'s right. But it didn\\'t end there, did it, Mrs. Choate? Oh no. Gimme that rye. Stop it. I want that rye lady. Help - someone help. Shut up, you old bag! No further questions. I call Marla Penny to the stand. Call Marla Penny. The virgin! And what was your connection to the defendants? I dated Mr. Seinfeld for several weeks in the autumn of 1992. Then on the evening of October 28, there was an abrupt end to that relationship. Tell us what happened. It\\'s rather difficult to talk about. It\\'s alright. Take your time. Well, I became aware of a - A what? A, uh - Yes? A contest. Contest? Yes. What was the nature of the contest? Oh please, I can\\'t. It\\'s okay. The four of them made a wager to see if they could - Yes? To see who could go the longest without gratifying themselves. For the love of God! It was horrible, horrible! Call Donald Sanger to the stand. Who the hell is that? Come on Donald, you\\'re doing fine. The Bubble Boy! Bubble Boy? That\\'s right, the Bubble Boy. What\\'s a Bubble Boy? He\\'s a boy who lives in a bubble. What the hell are all you looking at? So Donald, would you please tell the court about the incident that occurred in your house, October 7th, 1992. Well, Jerry Seinfeld was supposed to come to my house, but his friend Costanza showed up instead, so I challenged him to a game of Trivial Pursuit. Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century? That\\'s a joke - the Moors. Oh no - I\\'m so sorry, it\\'s the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops. Moops? Let me see that. That\\'s not Moops, you jerk. It\\'s Moors. It\\'s a misprint. Sorry, the card says Moops. It doesn\\'t matter. It\\'s Moors - there\\'s no Moops. It\\'s Moops. Moors! Moops! Help! Someone! There\\'s no Moops, you idiot. Stop it! Let go of him! Donald, stop it. No. Donald, stop it. It was Moops. Moors. the lady Kramer gave a defective wheelchair to in \"The Handicapped Spot\"] So Mr. Costanza parked in a handicapped spot, and as a result you got in an accident, and your wheelchair was destroyed? That\\'s right. And then Mr. Kramer gave you a used wheelchair? That\\'s right. Dr. Wilcox, the doctor on duty when Susan died] So you were the doctor on duty the night Susan Ross died? Yes, that\\'s right. It was May 16, 1996. I\\'ll never forget it. So you broke the news to Mr. Costanza? Could you tell the court, please, what his reaction was? I would describe it as restrained jubilation. Murderer! He killed our daughter! He knew those envelopes were toxic! Order in this court! Call Sidra Holland to the stand. Whew! Look at this one, she fine. You dated her? So you met Jerry Seinfeld in a health club sometime in 1993? Yes. And you also met Miss Benes in that same health club? Yes, that\\'s true. Would you describe the circumstances of that meeting. We were in the sauna, making chit-chat. You know, I\\'ve seen you around the club. My name\\'s Sidra. This is Marcie. Oh, hi, I\\'m Elaine. So, she pretended to trip, and she fell into your breasts? Yes. Why would she do something like that? Because he sent her in there to find out if they were real. Joe Bookman, library cop] State your name. Bookman, Joe Bookman. And what\\'s your occupation? I\\'m a library cop. What does a library cop do? We chase down library delinquents. Anyone in this room ever delinquent? Yeah, he was. Right over there - Seinfeld. How long was his book overdue? 25 years. We don\\'t call them delinquent after that long. What do you call them? Criminals. George\\'s old girlfriend] So you and Mr. Costanza were dating. Yes. And then what happened? Well, I invited him to attend my son\\'s birthday party and - Fire! Get out of the way! parking lot security guard] At the time, I was employed as a security guard in the parking lot at the Garden Valley Shopping Mall. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it\\'s against the law. I don\\'t know. Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that\\'s why. Uromycitisis! I wonder if they\\'re having any trouble controlling themselves during this trial? Perhaps these two hooligans would like to have a pee party right here in the courtroom! Objection, Your Honor! This is completely inappropriate! My clients\\' medical condition is not on trial here! I refer you to the Disability Act of 1990. Sit down, Mr. Chiles. Police Detective] Alright, Detective, then what happened? We got a tip that a lot of prostitutes had been turning tricks in the parking lot. You just cost me some money. Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it. Police officers - freeze right there! So Cosmo Kramer was, in fact, a pimp. the low-talker from \"The Puffy Shirt\"] So you asked Mr. Seinfeld if he would wear your puffy shirt on the Today Show? (Mumbles) Excuse me? Uh, excuse me, Your Honor, but what is the point of this testimony? This woman\\'s a low-talker. I can\\'t hear a word she\\'s saying. So either get some other kind of microphone up there, or let\\'s move on. George Steinbrenner] Call George Steinbrenner to the stand. Call George Steinbrenner. So George Costanza came to work for you in May of 1994? Yes, that\\'s right, he was good kid - a lovely boy. Shared his calzone with me - that was a heck of a sandwich, wasn\\'t it, Georgie? Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir. He had one little problem though. What was that? He was a communist. Thick as they come. Like a big juicy steak. How could you give twelve million dollars to Hideki Irabu?! Order! Marcellino from \"The Little Jerry\"] Cock fighting? Cock fighting. Pharmacist from \"The Sponge\"] Sponges. I don\\'t mean the kind you clean your tub with. They\\'re for sex. Said she needed a whole case of them. Elaine\\'s old boyfriend from work] She exposed her nipple. Mr. Pitt] How did she try to kill you? She tried to smother me with a pillow. Call Yev Kassem to the stand. Call Yev Kassem. Who? The Soup Nazi! Soup Nazi? You people have a little pet name for everybody. State your name. Yev Kassem. Could you spell that? No! Next question. How do you know the defendants? They used to come to my restaurant. Medium turkey chili. Medium crab bisque. I didn\\'t get any bread. Just forget it. Let it go. Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread. You want bread? Yes, please. Three dollars! What? No soup for you! But the idiot clowns did not know how to order. I banned that one - the woman - for a year. Then one day, she came back. Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds celery. That\\'s my recipe for wild mushroom. You\\'re through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next! She published my recipes. I had to close the store, move to Argentina. She ruined my business! Soup\\'s not all that good anyway. What did you say?! The state calls Mr. Babu Bhatt to the stand. How did they find Babu? I thought he was deported. You came a long way to be here today, haven\\'t you? And what\\'s your connection to the defendant? And then what happened? Hi everybody, I\\'m Geraldo Rivera and welcome to this special edition of Rivera Live. Well, arguments in the Good Samaritan trial ended today. The jury has been in deliberation for four and a half hours now. Let\\'s go live to Jane Wells who is in Latham, Massachusetts, covering this trial for us. Jane - Geraldo, just a few minutes ago, the jury asked to see the video tape. That\\'s the one where they are overheard making sarcastic remarks during the robbery. Yes, it\\'s a very incriminating piece of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo, this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four seemingly ordinary people. One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay didn\\'t finally put a stop to it, it could\\'ve gone on for months. Jane, whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this jury? That is so hard to say. Certainly there\\'s the doctor with the poison invitations. The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure. And that bizarre contest certainly didn\\'t sit well with this small town jury.There\\'s the woman they sold the defective wheelchair to, the deported Pakistani restaurateur. Geraldo, it just went on, and on, and on, into the night. And so we wait. Do they make you wear uniforms in prison? I think so. It\\'s not that bright orange one is it? I hope it\\'s not that one, because I cannot wear orange. Will you stop worrying? Jackie\\'s going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. Did you see the look on his face? Sorry to bother you, Judge. How did you get in here? Please, if he\\'s found guilty, please be kind to him. He\\'s a good boy. This is highly irregular. Well, maybe there\\'s something I can do for you. What do you mean? You know Oh, Jackie, you\\'re so articulate. We have plenty of time, too. This jury could be out for days. Hello? Damn. They\\'re ready. Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down? I\\'ve always loved ... United Airlines. I think it\\'s going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me. Maybe because she knows you\\'re going to jail. All rise. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict? We have, Your Honor. Will the defendants please rise. And how do you find, with respect to the charge of criminal indifference? We find the defendants - guilty. Order! Order in this court, I will clear this room! I do not know how, or under what circumstances the four of you found each other, but your callous indifference and utter disregard for everything that is good and decent has rocked the very foundation upon which our society is built. I can think of nothing more fitting than for the four of youto spend a year removed from society so that you can contemplate the manner in which you have conducted yourselves. I know I will. This court is adjourned. You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane. Puddy, don\\'t wait for me. Alright. We gotta get out of here. We want to beat the traffic. Come on, Jackie. Let\\'s go. What? Oh, and by the way, they\\'re real, and they\\'re spectacular. Well, it\\'s only a year. That\\'s not so bad. We\\'ll be out in a year, and then we\\'ll be back Could be fun. Don\\'t have to worry about your meals, or what you\\'re going to do Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe \"Bye Bye Birdie\" or \"My Fair Lady\". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle. Why don\\'t you just blow it out your a... If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones? Sure. Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls. I think that would be a very nice gesture. I got it - it\\'s out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief. See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. Really? Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it\\'s too high, it\\'s in no-man\\'s land. Haven\\'t we had this conversation before? You think? I think we have. Yeah, maybe we have. So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn\\'t have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what\\'s with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D? I am. I\\'ll talk slower. I\\'m kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir? Murder one. Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I\\'m only kidding sir - lighten up. How about you, what are you in for? Grand theft auto. Grand theft auto - don\\'t steal any of my jokes. You suck - I\\'m gonna cut you. Hey, I don\\'t come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand. Alright, Seinfeld, that\\'s it. Let\\'s go. Come on. Alright, hey, you\\'ve been great! See you in the cafeteria.'"

       "0  Do you know what this is all about? Do you know, why were here? To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people talking about We should go out? This is what theyre talking about...this whole thing, were all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, were all out! There are people tryin to find us, they dont know where we are. (on an imaginary phone) Did you ring?, I cant find him. Where did he go? He didnt tell me where he was going. He must have gone out. You wanna go out you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...Then youre standing around, whatta you do? You go We gotta be getting back. Once youre out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, its my feeling, youve gotta go.

       "1  So, Im on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of me. One of them, her total was eight dollars, the other three dollars. They both of course choose to pay by the use of the... Cheque. Cheque. Now, the fact is, if its a woman in front of you thats writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, yknow, cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they dont know where that is, but the cheque book they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster (Jerry draws imaginary book from a holster.) Who do I make it out to? Theres my ID. Theres something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I dont know exactly what it is. I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, I dont have any money, but if youll contact these people, Im sure theyll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time- I dont have any money bu...   \n",
       "2  So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. Its a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and Im supposed to feel bad. Is that the way its supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldnt you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. Cause its not easy to give someone the toe, youve gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and... (Jerry pretends to drive with one foot in the air, giving the toe.) Look at that toe, buddy. (He puts his foot down.) I mean, thats really insulting to get the toe, isnt it? Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. (Jerry zips his bag ceremoniously.) Thats it. Done! (cl...   \n",
       "3  Most men like working on things. Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guys out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, its true, men hear a drill, its like a dog whistle. Just... (his head perks up) you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, Honey, I think Jims working on something over there. So they run over to the guy. Now they dont actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. Thats what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, What are you using, a Phillips-head? You know, we feel involved. Thats why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, thats just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for u...   \n",
       "4  Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because moneys a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you dont care about money when youre hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, youre like the ruler of an empire. More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives. Then after the meal, you know, youve got the pants open, youve got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. Theyre mystified by the check. What is this? How could this be? They start passing it around the table, Does this look right to you? Were not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food? I think Superman probably has a very good sense of humor. I never heard him say anything really funny. But its common sense. Hes got super strength, super speed.

       "'I can\\'t eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? \"How\\'s everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?\" I know what you mean. Do ya? It\\'s like going out with someone and you never hear from them again. Same thing! Not really, but it\\'s something. Ask the people behind you. Excuse me. Are you using your catsup? What do you think? You want to give him the catsup? It\\'s up to you. You know what? I don\\'t think so. I\\'m going to need it from time to time. So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies? Nah - what for? To see a movie. I\\'ve been to the movies. Not this movie. They\\'re all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I\\'m sick of it. Did you shower today? Yeah. That\\'s usually the kind of mood I\\'m in when I haven\\'t showered. When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my 15 minutes! Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health. Ah! Health\\'s not good enough. I want more than health. Health\\'s not doing it for me anymore. I\\'m sick of health. All right, we\\'re done. You can have it now. Oh, very gracious. Nice day Yeah. What is that? Hey! JoJo! Ey, ey! All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer. No, thank you. So what are you doing? Nothing. Come on, let\\'s go to the beach. What are you crazy? What? It\\'s a beautiful day. Have a good time. Yeah, there\\'s something in the air today. You feel it? There\\'s something in the air. You know you\\'re turning into Burt Lancaster? Yeah, there\\'s something in the air. Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it\\'s Elaine. How is your father? Is everything okay? What? I can\\'t hear you so good. There\\'s a lot of static. Wha? I\\'m going to call you back. Jill\\'s father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone? What? No good? Faux pas. Faux pas? Big hefty stinking faux pas. Why? You can\\'t make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It\\'s like saying \"I don\\'t want to take up any of my important time in my home so I\\'ll just get it out of the way on the street.\" On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make. It\\'s an act of total disregard. It\\'s selfish. It\\'s dismissive. It\\'s pompous. Why don\\'t you think before you do something? Here\\'s a thought - Bye bye. Too much? Boy - I\\'m really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should know better than that. Hey - hey - hey! What? Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend. You\\'re so uptight. Uptight? Let\\'s all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket. We\\'re going up to Jerry\\'s. It\\'s a pee party. Jerry, this is Elizabeth Clark calling from James Kimbrough\\'s office at NBC. Could you please give us a call?Thanks. Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi? Uh huh, really, uh, no problem, definitely, ok, buhbye. That was James Kimbrough. Who\\'s he? He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about \"Jerry.\" Our show, \"Jerry\"? Right. \"Jerry\", oh my God. He wants to talk about \"Jerry\"? Yeah! When? Today, like right now. Right now? \"Jerry\"? \"Jerry\"! He wants to talk about \"Jerry\"? He wants to talk about \"Jerry\"! \"Jerry\"! \"Jerry\"! Can I go like this? Sure! No sports jacket? I don\\'t need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets. Forget the sports jacket. I won\\'t feel like a writer. You\\'re not a writer. Right! Water. Need some water! Water here! Ok, now listen, I don\\'t want any scenes in here like the last time. Don\\'t worry, don\\'t worry, no scenes. Don\\'t blow this. I will not blow this. If he says he doesn\\'t want it to be a show about nothing, don\\'t go nuts. It\\'s fine, it doesn\\'t have to be about nothing. He might not want nothing. Something, nothing, I could care less. He might want a show about anything and everything. Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I\\'m down! All right. Mr. Kimbrough is ready to see you Magic time. What? nothing Mr. Kimbrough. Hey, Jerry, good to see you. Hey, hey, hey! How you been? Good, good. You remember George. George, good to see you. Hello Stu. You remember Jay Crespi. Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi? This is James Kimbrough. Nice to meet you, pleasure, thanks for coming in. Kimbrough. Don\\'t spell. K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H That\\'s right. It\\'s a talent I have. Why don\\'t we sit down, glad you\\'re here. Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It\\'s crisp - it\\'s crispy crisp. Shut up, George. Can I get you anything? What do we have in the fruit department? Oy. Pineapple. Oh, that\\'s a dangerous fruit. It\\'s like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things. Anyway, let me tell you why I called. When I took over here last month, I reviewed what was in development,and it was pretty much same old, same old. Been there, done that. Right. I was looking for something different. Something that would have people talking at the water coolers. Water coolers? We call it a water-cooler show. Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to talk about it, right? See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines. Well it\\'s probably just easier to say \"water cooler show\" than \"coffee machine show.\" It\\'s really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles. But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point. Anyway, Stu here started telling me about a show, \"Jerry\", that he developed five years ago. I have always loved it. He said it was a show about nothing. So, I saw the pilot and I\\'ve got to tell you - I flipped out. He totally flipped out. What I want to do is put it on the air. 13-episode commitment. Start it off on Wednesday night, build up an audience. This show needs time to grow. I love that Kramer guy. He\\'s a little off the wall. Oh yeah. Kramer. And Elaine - I wouldn\\'t mind seeing something happening between you two. Definitely. I tell you, I really don\\'t think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about. Or we could not do the show altogether, how about that? Or we could get them together. Woo! Yeah! Yeah! Jill, hi, it\\'s Elaine. Well, I\\'m calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was just calling to see how your fa.. I\\'m sorry, I\\'m getting another call. Hang on just a second. Hello? Hi. Elaine, it\\'s me. Jerry, I\\'m on the other line. No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone. I\\'m sorry, Jill. I\\'m going to have to take this call. Jerry, what\\'s the emergency? The \"Jerry\"\\'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to California! That\\'s the emergency? Did you hear what I said? I was on the other line talking to Jill. Jill? Well, why didn\\'t you say so? You said it was an emergency. So now she\\'s lost a phone face-off? That\\'s even worse than your cell phone walk-and-talk. Congratulations, they\\'re doing the show. They should have put that show on 5 years ago. Bunch of idiots at that network. Can I tell you something, Jerry? It\\'s all crap on TV. The only thing I watch is Xena the Warrior Princess. She must be about six-six. She\\'s not six-six. Jerry, you ever watch that? Yeah, it\\'s pretty good. They picked up the show? I\\'m moving to California. Oh baby-doll, this kid\\'s going places, I told you. The NBC guy liked it? Of course he liked it. He told you he liked it? He wouldn\\'t put it on if he didn\\'t like it. Well, what are you doing? I\\'m writing. You know how to write? Without the writing, you have nothing. You\\'re the ones that make them look good. Since when do you know how to write? I never saw you write anything. Ma?! I don\\'t know how you\\'re going to write all those shows. And where are you get all the ideas? Would you leave him alone? You\\'ll shatter his confidence! I don\\'t need any ideas. It\\'s a show about nothing. Nothing. Please. I\\'ll tell you the truth - the whole thing sounds pretty stupid to me. NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That\\'s fantastic! Thanks. Great. Okay, bye. Oh hey! Hey - how was the beach? Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing? You know, I went swimming and I can\\'t get this water out of my ear. So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, \"Jerry\"? Well, the new guy at NBC wants to do it. They\\'re putting it on the air! They\\'re giving us a 13-episode commitment. George and I are moving to California! You\\'re moving to California? Yeah, only for a while. Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show\\'s a hit? You could be out there for years! You might never come back. No, I\\'ll be back. Jerry. It\\'s L.A. Nobody leaves. She\\'s a seductress, she\\'s a siren, she\\'s a virgin, she\\'s a whore. And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we\\'ll all go somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California. Fling! So we can go anywhere we want? Anywhere. Why are they doing this? I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their shelf for five years. This is all very exciting. So? Where are we going? I say Japan. Why Japan? Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They\\'re shy at first, but they\\'re quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking. Oh - I got it - how about Russia? Russia, it\\'s so bleak. It\\'s not bleak - it\\'s springtime. It\\'s still bleak. You can\\'t be bleak in spring. You can be bleak in spring. If you\\'re bleak, you\\'re bleak. What about Switzerland? Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh? It\\'s a bit hilly - no? You\\'re not going to do any walking. What if I want to walk around a little? So then you\\'ll walk down the hill and we\\'ll pick you up. What if I\\'m at the bottom? All right! You know what, just forget it! Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let\\'s face it, we\\'re not all going to agree on anything. Why don\\'t we all just go to Paris? I\\'ll go to Paris. Me too. Oh yeah - oui oui. So that\\'s it - it\\'s settled, we\\'re going to Paris. Yeah! Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I\\'m just going to call Jill one more time before we go. Wait, you can\\'t make a call like that on your way out. You can\\'t rush that conversation. Well, I can\\'t call from the limo. Can I call from the plane? First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting face-off, now you\\'re talking about a plane call? All right, I\\'ll just have to call her from Paris. Hello, Jerry. Hello, Newman. What gives? I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private jet to Paris? Yeah, that\\'s right. Well, I hear it\\'s quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you know I\\'m one-quarter French. Really. Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won\\'t interest you, but I have a cousin there who\\'s suffering very badly. She\\'s lost all use of her muscles. She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine into her tragic life. But alas, I can\\'t afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple postal worker. That\\'s a shame. Take me! Take me! Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You\\'re making me sick. Be a man! All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my words, Seinfeld - your day of reckoning is coming. When an evil wind will blow through your little playworld, and wipe that smug smile off your face. And I\\'ll be there, in all my glory, watching - watching as it all comes crumbling down. Ah, Jerry? Yeah. I\\'m Captain Maddox this is my co-pilot, Kurt Adams. Ready to go to Paris? All set. We\\'ll just grab the bags. Don\\'t worry about that. We\\'ll take care of them for you. Just keeps on getting better and better. Not bad. Wow! The only way to fly. This is it? I\\'m sorry - I have to say, I\\'m a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer. You\\'re complaining about a private jet? You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets? Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore. Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one. Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip. This is a real piece of junk. I don\\'t even feel safe on this thing. I have a good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough. You\\'re not writing any letters! Will you turn around? Why? You are annoying me sitting like that. It\\'s effeminate. It\\'s effeminate to sit like this? Yes, I think it\\'s a little effeminate. How is this effeminate? I don\\'t know - it just is. Kramer, what are you doing? Still got water in your ear? Can\\'t get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain. Would you stop that? It\\'s not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane. I got to get it out, I can\\'t take this anymore. Kramer, don\\'t be fooling around up here. Kramer! Hey, get the hell out of here! What is that? Oh my God! What is that noise? What is that noise? Kramer, what the hell did you do? I lost my balance. Oh my God! What\\'s going on? Kramer! It was an accident. I told you to stop with the hopping. Oh my God, we\\'re going down. We\\'re going to die! Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn\\'t let me be successful. Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can\\'t- it can\\'t end like this. I\\'m ready! I\\'m ready! Glory hallelujah! Jerry? Jerry can you hear me? Yeah. There\\'s something I have to tell you. What? What is it? I cheated in the contest. What? What? The contest - I cheated. Why? Because I\\'m a cheater! I had to tell you. Great - I won. Jerry, I gotta tell you something too. Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you. No no - me first. Alright. Jerry, I\\'ve always loved ..u.. Hey - What\\'s going on? We\\'re straightening out! We\\'re straightening out? We\\'re straightening out! We\\'re straightening out! Yeah! Well, again, sorry about that little mishap. But once you get everything checked out there shouldn\\'t be anymore problems. Where are we? Latham, Massachusetts. Why don\\'t you take a cab into town, get yourself something to eat. I got your beeper number - I\\'ll beep you as soon as we\\'re ready. Okay. Okay. We\\'ll see you later. Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get back on this plane? I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight. I\\'m not getting on a regular plane now - I\\'m all psyched up to go on a private jet. No way I\\'m getting on a regular plane. Well, I\\'m sure that they would fly us first class. First class doesn\\'t make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane. Alright, I\\'ll feel him out. Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up. Nice day. Another one? Alright fatso, out of the car. I want to capture this. Come on! Gimme your wallet. Don\\'t shoot. Well, there goes the money for the lipo. See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it\\'s an easy getaway. You know? They can\\'t really chase ya! He\\'s actually doing him a favor. It\\'s less money for him to buy food. I want your wallet. Come on. Come on, come on. That\\'s a shame. Alright, I\\'m gonna call NBC. Officer, he\\'s stealing my car! Officer, I was carjacked. I was held up at gunpoint! He took my wallet, everything! Okay, thanks anyway. They can\\'t get another plane. All right, what\\'s wrong with the plane we got? They\\'re just checking it out. Forget it. No, no, no. We\\'re not getting on there. Come on, let\\'s go get something to eat in Sticksville. All right, hold it right there. What? You\\'re under arrest. Under arrest? What for? Article 223-7 of the Latham County Penal Code. What? No, no - we didn\\'t do anything. That\\'s exactly right. The law requires you to help or assist anyone in danger as long as it\\'s reasonable todo so. I never heard of that. It\\'s new. It\\'s called the Good Samaritan Law. Let\\'s go. The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy? Why would we want to help somebody? I know. That\\'s what nuns and Red Cross workers are for. The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people. Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is. Well, they just passed it last year. It\\'s modeled after the French law. I heard about it after Princess Diana was killed and all those photographers were just standing around. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You\\'re the first ones to be arrested on it, probably in the whole country. All right, so what\\'s the penalty here? Let\\'s just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here. Well, it\\'s not that easy. Now see, the law calls for a maximum fine of $85,000 and as much as five years in prison. What? Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We\\'re starting a TV show. California? Oh gosh, I don\\'t think so. Yeah, my guess is you\\'re gonna be prosecuted. Better get yourselves a good lawyer. Who told you to put the cheese on? Did I tell you to put the cheese on? I didn\\'t tell you to put the cheese on. Jerry Seinfeld on the phone. You people with the cheese. It never ends. Hello? Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Good Samaritan Law? I never heard of it. You don\\'t have to help anybody. That\\'s what this country\\'s all about. That\\'s deplorable, unfathomable, improbable. Hold on. Suzie, cancel my appointment with Dr. Bison. And pack a bag for me. I want to get to Latham, Massachusetts,right away. So they got Jackie Chiles, huh? (Sets down the newspaper) Uh hmm. You know what that means. This whole place is going to be swarming with media by the time this thing is over. You\\'re not going to be able to find a hotel room in this town. The whole country is going to be watching us. Now we got to do whatever it takes to win it, no matter what the cost. The big issue in this trial is going to be character. I want you to find out everything you can about these people - and I mean everything. Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh? Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that\\'s it. I realize we\\'re prisoners, but we\\'re still entitled to catsup. I guess we could\\'ve called for help. But then we would have missed the whole thing. I still had it on video. We could have watched it later. Yeah, he\\'s right. I forgot about the video. Sure - the video. What is that? Plane\\'s ready. Hi everybody, I\\'m Geraldo Rivera. Tonight we\\'ll be talking about what most of you have probably been discussing in your homes, and around the water coolers in your offices. I am speaking of course of the controversial Good Samaritan trial that gets underway Thursday in Latham, Massachusetts. Now before we meet our distinguished panel, let\\'s go to Latham live, where Jane Wells is standing by. Jane- Yes. Good evening, Geraldo. What\\'s the mood? What\\'s going on tonight? Well, Latham is fairly quite tonight, considering the media circus that has descended upon this quaint little town. And what about the defendants - the so-called New York Four. How are they holding up? Well, I did speak with one of the deputies who had some contact with them, and he told me quote \"There\\'s no love lost with that group.\" Anything else, Jane? There also seems to be some friction between Mr. Seinfeld, and Ms. Benes. The rumor is that they once dated, and it\\'s possible that ended badly. Well, ladies and gentlemen, who know, maybe this trial will bring them closer together. Maybe they\\'ll even end up getting married. I hope you packed enough - this trial could last for weeks. What\\'s all that? Cereal. You\\'re packing cereal? I\\'m bringing it for Jerry. You got enough here for a life sentence. He likes it. He says he misses that more that anything. So bring a snack-pack. Poor Georgie, was it our fault this happened to him? Did we do something wrong? Maybe it was our fault. Maybe it was your fault. It wasn\\'t my fault. I can tell you that. Oh, so it was my fault, but not yours. You were the one who smothered him. I did not smother him. You smothered! He couldn\\'t get any air! He couldn\\'t breathe! He was suffocating! Sure, and you were always in Korea with your religious chachkis. I had to make a living! This is excellent huh? Don\\'t worry I didn\\'t use too much milk, cause I know we gotta make it last. You know I\\'ve had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I\\'ve always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can\\'t even see the milk anymore. It\\'s a big adjustment. I bet. It\\'s one of the hardest things I\\'ve ever had to do. Good morning. Good morning, Jackie. Good morning. Is everybody ready? Didn\\'t I tell you I wanted you to wear the cardigan? It makes me look older. Look older? Do you think this is a game? Is that what you think this is? I\\'m trying to give you amoral compass. You have no moral compass. You\\'re going to walk into that courtroom, and the jury\\'s going to see a mean, nasty, evil George Costanza. I want them to see Perry Como. No one\\'s going to convict Perry Como. Perry Como helps out a fat tub who\\'s getting robbed. Do you think it\\'s funny? No. You damn right it isn\\'t. You better not be carrying on laughing in that courtroom, funny man. Cause if you start getting all smart-alecky, making wisecracks, acting a fool, you gonna find yourself in here for a long, long time. I don\\'t like that tie. Suzie, get one of my ties from my briefcase. How do I look, Jackie? Oh, you looking good. You look strong. You one fine-looking sexy lady. Thank you, Jackie. How bout me, Jackie? Kramer, you always look good. You got respect for yourself. You\\'re genuine. Jury\\'s going to pick up on that. Here. This one? That\\'s right. Do I have to? Jackie says put it on, Jerry. All rise. Fourth District County Court, Latham, Massachusetts is now in session. The Honorable Judge Arthur Vandelay presiding. Vandelay? The judge\\'s name is Vandelay? Vanda who? Jerry, did you hear that? Yeah. I think that\\'s a good sign. Is the District Attorney ready to proceed? We are, Your Honor. Mr. Hoyt. Ladies and gentlemen, last year, our City Council by a vote of twelve to two, passed a Good Samaritan Law. Now, essentially, we made it a crime to ignore a fellow human being in trouble. Now this group from New York not only ignored, but, as we will prove, they actually mocked the victim as he was being robbed at gunpoint. I can guarantee you one other thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time they have behaved in this manner. On the contrary, they have quite a record of mocking and maligning. This is a history of selfishness, self-absorption, immaturity, and greed. And you will see how everyone who has come into contact with these four individuals has been abused, wronged, deceived and betrayed. This time, they have gone too far. This time they are going to be held accountable. This time, they are the ones who will pay. Mr. Chiles. I am shocked and chagrined, mortified and stupefied. This trial is outrageous! It is a waste of the taxpayers\\' time and money. It is a travesty of justice that these four people have been incarcerated while the real perpetrator is walking around laughing - lying and laughing, laughing and lying. You know what these four people were? They were innocentbystanders. Now, you just think about that term. Innocent. Bystanders. Because that\\'s exactly what they were. We know theywere bystanders, nobody\\'s disputing that. So how can a bystander be guilty? No such thing. Have you ever heard of a guilty bystander? No, because you cannot be a bystander and be guilty. Bystanders are by definition, innocent. That is the nature of bystanding. But no, they want to change nature here. They want to create a whole new animal - the guilty bystander. Don\\'t you let them do it. Only you can stop them. Is the prosecution ready to present its first witness? We are, Your Honor. Call Officer Matt Vogel to the stand. Call Matt Vogel. So they were just standing there? Yes. Did one of them have a video camera? Yes. Your Honor, with the court\\'s permission, we would like to play back that video and enter it into evidence as Exhibit A. Proceed. Don\\'t shoot. Well, there goes the money for the lipo. See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it\\'s an easy getaway. They can\\'t really chase ya! He\\'s actually doing him a favor. It\\'s less money for him to buy food. the victim of the robbery] So they just stood there and did nothing? Yeah, nothing. Nothing! No further questions. Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us killed! Call Mabel Choate to the stand. Call Mabel Choate. Your Honor. I most strenuously and vigorously object to this witness. She was not present at the time of the incident. Her testimony is irrelevant, irrational, and inconsequential. Your Honor, the prosecution has gone to great lengths and considerable cost to find these character witnesses.It is imperative that we establish this is not merely an isolated incident. It\\'s part of a pattern of anti-social behavior that\\'s been going on for years. Objection overruled. I\\'ll hear the witness. Now, Mrs. Choate, would you please tell the court what happen the evening of January 4th. Well, I was in Snitzer\\'s Bakery when I got accosted by that man. Let the record show that she is pointing at Mr. Seinfeld. What did he want? My marble rye. Your marble rye? I got the last one. He kept persisting, and I said no. And then you left the bakery. That\\'s right. But it didn\\'t end there, did it, Mrs. Choate? Oh no. Gimme that rye. Stop it. I want that rye lady. Help - someone help. Shut up, you old bag! No further questions. I call Marla Penny to the stand. Call Marla Penny. The virgin! And what was your connection to the defendants? I dated Mr. Seinfeld for several weeks in the autumn of 1992. Then on the evening of October 28, there was an abrupt end to that relationship. Tell us what happened. It\\'s rather difficult to talk about. It\\'s alright. Take your time. Well, I became aware of a - A what? A, uh - Yes? A contest. Contest? Yes. What was the nature of the contest? Oh please, I can\\'t. It\\'s okay. The four of them made a wager to see if they could - Yes? To see who could go the longest without gratifying themselves. For the love of God! It was horrible, horrible! Call Donald Sanger to the stand. Who the hell is that? Come on Donald, you\\'re doing fine. The Bubble Boy! Bubble Boy? That\\'s right, the Bubble Boy. What\\'s a Bubble Boy? He\\'s a boy who lives in a bubble. What the hell are all you looking at? So Donald, would you please tell the court about the incident that occurred in your house, October 7th, 1992. Well, Jerry Seinfeld was supposed to come to my house, but his friend Costanza showed up instead, so I challenged him to a game of Trivial Pursuit. Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century? That\\'s a joke - the Moors. Oh no - I\\'m so sorry, it\\'s the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops. Moops? Let me see that. That\\'s not Moops, you jerk. It\\'s Moors. It\\'s a misprint. Sorry, the card says Moops. It doesn\\'t matter. It\\'s Moors - there\\'s no Moops. It\\'s Moops. Moors! Moops! Help! Someone! There\\'s no Moops, you idiot. Stop it! Let go of him! Donald, stop it. No. Donald, stop it. It was Moops. Moors. the lady Kramer gave a defective wheelchair to in \"The Handicapped Spot\"] So Mr. Costanza parked in a handicapped spot, and as a result you got in an accident, and your wheelchair was destroyed? That\\'s right. And then Mr. Kramer gave you a used wheelchair? That\\'s right. Dr. Wilcox, the doctor on duty when Susan died] So you were the doctor on duty the night Susan Ross died? Yes, that\\'s right. It was May 16, 1996. I\\'ll never forget it. So you broke the news to Mr. Costanza? Could you tell the court, please, what his reaction was? I would describe it as restrained jubilation. Murderer! He killed our daughter! He knew those envelopes were toxic! Order in this court! Call Sidra Holland to the stand. Whew! Look at this one, she fine. You dated her? So you met Jerry Seinfeld in a health club sometime in 1993? Yes. And you also met Miss Benes in that same health club? Yes, that\\'s true. Would you describe the circumstances of that meeting. We were in the sauna, making chit-chat. You know, I\\'ve seen you around the club. My name\\'s Sidra. This is Marcie. Oh, hi, I\\'m Elaine. So, she pretended to trip, and she fell into your breasts? Yes. Why would she do something like that? Because he sent her in there to find out if they were real. Joe Bookman, library cop] State your name. Bookman, Joe Bookman. And what\\'s your occupation? I\\'m a library cop. What does a library cop do? We chase down library delinquents. Anyone in this room ever delinquent? Yeah, he was. Right over there - Seinfeld. How long was his book overdue? 25 years. We don\\'t call them delinquent after that long. What do you call them? Criminals. George\\'s old girlfriend] So you and Mr. Costanza were dating. Yes. And then what happened? Well, I invited him to attend my son\\'s birthday party and - Fire! Get out of the way! parking lot security guard] At the time, I was employed as a security guard in the parking lot at the Garden Valley Shopping Mall. Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it\\'s against the law. I don\\'t know. Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that\\'s why. Uromycitisis! I wonder if they\\'re having any trouble controlling themselves during this trial? Perhaps these two hooligans would like to have a pee party right here in the courtroom! Objection, Your Honor! This is completely inappropriate! My clients\\' medical condition is not on trial here! I refer you to the Disability Act of 1990. Sit down, Mr. Chiles. Police Detective] Alright, Detective, then what happened? We got a tip that a lot of prostitutes had been turning tricks in the parking lot. You just cost me some money. Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it. Police officers - freeze right there! So Cosmo Kramer was, in fact, a pimp. the low-talker from \"The Puffy Shirt\"] So you asked Mr. Seinfeld if he would wear your puffy shirt on the Today Show? (Mumbles) Excuse me? Uh, excuse me, Your Honor, but what is the point of this testimony? This woman\\'s a low-talker. I can\\'t hear a word she\\'s saying. So either get some other kind of microphone up there, or let\\'s move on. George Steinbrenner] Call George Steinbrenner to the stand. Call George Steinbrenner. So George Costanza came to work for you in May of 1994? Yes, that\\'s right, he was good kid - a lovely boy. Shared his calzone with me - that was a heck of a sandwich, wasn\\'t it, Georgie? Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir. He had one little problem though. What was that? He was a communist. Thick as they come. Like a big juicy steak. How could you give twelve million dollars to Hideki Irabu?! Order! Marcellino from \"The Little Jerry\"] Cock fighting? Cock fighting. Pharmacist from \"The Sponge\"] Sponges. I don\\'t mean the kind you clean your tub with. They\\'re for sex. Said she needed a whole case of them. Elaine\\'s old boyfriend from work] She exposed her nipple. Mr. Pitt] How did she try to kill you? She tried to smother me with a pillow. Call Yev Kassem to the stand. Call Yev Kassem. Who? The Soup Nazi! Soup Nazi? You people have a little pet name for everybody. State your name. Yev Kassem. Could you spell that? No! Next question. How do you know the defendants? They used to come to my restaurant. Medium turkey chili. Medium crab bisque. I didn\\'t get any bread. Just forget it. Let it go. Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread. You want bread? Yes, please. Three dollars! What? No soup for you! But the idiot clowns did not know how to order. I banned that one - the woman - for a year. Then one day, she came back. Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds celery. That\\'s my recipe for wild mushroom. You\\'re through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next! She published my recipes. I had to close the store, move to Argentina. She ruined my business! Soup\\'s not all that good anyway. What did you say?! The state calls Mr. Babu Bhatt to the stand. How did they find Babu? I thought he was deported. You came a long way to be here today, haven\\'t you? And what\\'s your connection to the defendant? And then what happened? Hi everybody, I\\'m Geraldo Rivera and welcome to this special edition of Rivera Live. Well, arguments in the Good Samaritan trial ended today. The jury has been in deliberation for four and a half hours now. Let\\'s go live to Jane Wells who is in Latham, Massachusetts, covering this trial for us. Jane - Geraldo, just a few minutes ago, the jury asked to see the video tape. That\\'s the one where they are overheard making sarcastic remarks during the robbery. Yes, it\\'s a very incriminating piece of evidence. But I must tell you, Geraldo, this courtroom and everyone who has attended this trial is still reeling from the endless parade of witness who have come forth so enthusiastically to testify against these four seemingly ordinary people. One even had the feeling that if Judge Vandelay didn\\'t finally put a stop to it, it could\\'ve gone on for months. Jane, whose testimony do you think resonated most strongly with this jury? That is so hard to say. Certainly there\\'s the doctor with the poison invitations. The Bubble Boy was an extremely sympathetic and tragic figure. And that bizarre contest certainly didn\\'t sit well with this small town jury.There\\'s the woman they sold the defective wheelchair to, the deported Pakistani restaurateur. Geraldo, it just went on, and on, and on, into the night. And so we wait. Do they make you wear uniforms in prison? I think so. It\\'s not that bright orange one is it? I hope it\\'s not that one, because I cannot wear orange. Will you stop worrying? Jackie\\'s going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. Did you see the look on his face? Sorry to bother you, Judge. How did you get in here? Please, if he\\'s found guilty, please be kind to him. He\\'s a good boy. This is highly irregular. Well, maybe there\\'s something I can do for you. What do you mean? You know Oh, Jackie, you\\'re so articulate. We have plenty of time, too. This jury could be out for days. Hello? Damn. They\\'re ready. Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down? I\\'ve always loved ... United Airlines. I think it\\'s going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me. Maybe because she knows you\\'re going to jail. All rise. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict? We have, Your Honor. Will the defendants please rise. And how do you find, with respect to the charge of criminal indifference? We find the defendants - guilty. Order! Order in this court, I will clear this room! I do not know how, or under what circumstances the four of you found each other, but your callous indifference and utter disregard for everything that is good and decent has rocked the very foundation upon which our society is built. I can think of nothing more fitting than for the four of youto spend a year removed from society so that you can contemplate the manner in which you have conducted yourselves. I know I will. This court is adjourned. You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane. Puddy, don\\'t wait for me. Alright. We gotta get out of here. We want to beat the traffic. Come on, Jackie. Let\\'s go. What? Oh, and by the way, they\\'re real, and they\\'re spectacular. Well, it\\'s only a year. That\\'s not so bad. We\\'ll be out in a year, and then we\\'ll be back Could be fun. Don\\'t have to worry about your meals, or what you\\'re going to do Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe \"Bye Bye Birdie\" or \"My Fair Lady\". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle. Why don\\'t you just blow it out your a... If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones? Sure. Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls. I think that would be a very nice gesture. I got it - it\\'s out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief. See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. Really? Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it\\'s too high, it\\'s in no-man\\'s land. Haven\\'t we had this conversation before? You think? I think we have. Yeah, maybe we have. So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn\\'t have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what\\'s with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D? I am. I\\'ll talk slower. I\\'m kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir? Murder one. Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I\\'m only kidding sir - lighten up. How about you, what are you in for? Grand theft auto. Grand theft auto - don\\'t steal any of my jokes. You suck - I\\'m gonna cut you. Hey, I don\\'t come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of your hand. Alright, Seinfeld, that\\'s it. Let\\'s go. Come on. Alright, hey, you\\'ve been great! See you in the cafeteria.'"

They walk out, twirl, walk off. We just sit in the audience and go, That was nice. I could wear that. I think Ive seen enough. Well, I might have something in the back. The back?
