# Introduction
Seinfeld is an American television sitcom that ran for nine seasons on NBC, from 1989 to 1998. It was created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, with the latter starring as a fictionalized version of himself. Set predominantly in an apartment building in Manhattan's Upper West Side in New York City, the show features a handful of Jerry's friends and acquaintances, including best friend George Costanza, friend and former girlfriend Elaine Benes, and neighbor across the hall Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards). It is often described as being "a show about nothing", as many of its episodes are about the minutiae of daily life.

I have been a huge fan of this show for around two decades, and still find myself going back and enjoying old episodes. I think the writing is absolutely brilliant, still holds up (even if some references are dated), and really appreciate the way that Larry David in particular can transform seemingly mundane daily occurrences into entertaining dialogue. 

I discovered a database containing scripts for every Seinfeld episode, with dialogue separated by character. Since we have learned so much about NLP recently, and because NLP has so many practical applications, I thought this would be a fun corpus to take on, and try to extract meaning from. I also thought it would be a very interesting problem to try and see if I can train a model to emulate the speech patterns of the four main characters mentioned above, and even create a model that would “predict”/generate the script for a new episode of Seinfeld.
